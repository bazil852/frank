# Empty Tool Arguments Fix ✅

## The Problem

The model was calling `update_business_profile` but with **empty arguments**:

```
⚙️  Executing tool 2: update_business_profile
args: {}  // ❌ EMPTY!

📋 Business Profile Tool: update_business_profile { args: {}, userId: '...' }
✅ Updated profile with: {}  // Nothing saved
✅ Tool result: { success: true, updated: {}, message: 'Successfully updated 0 field(s)' }
```

**Result:** Profile never saved, searches returned empty results.

## Root Cause

The model was:
1. ✅ Recognizing it should call `update_business_profile`
2. ❌ Not extracting the data from the user message
3. ❌ Calling the tool with no arguments: `update_business_profile()`

This is because the system prompt didn't explicitly show **what arguments to pass** when calling tools.

## The Solution

### Added Explicit "WRONG vs RIGHT" Example

Added to system prompt [lib/openai-client-tools.ts](lib/openai-client-tools.ts:37-48):

```markdown
**CRITICAL: When calling update_business_profile, you MUST pass the extracted data as arguments!**

WRONG (don't do this):
update_business_profile()  // ❌ No arguments - nothing saved!

RIGHT (do this):
update_business_profile({
  industry: "Construction",
  yearsTrading: 5,
  monthlyTurnover: 100000,
  amountRequested: 1000000
})  // ✅ Arguments with extracted data
```

### Updated Example Flow

Changed the example from:
```
2. update_business_profile({industry: "Construction", ...})
```

To:
```
2. update_business_profile({industry: "Construction", yearsTrading: 5, monthlyTurnover: 100000, amountRequested: 1000000})  // ⚠️ MUST include the data!
```

Now shows **inline comment** emphasizing the requirement.

## Why This Works

### Explicit Negative Example
Shows what **NOT** to do:
```
update_business_profile()  // ❌ No arguments
```

This teaches the model by counter-example.

### Explicit Positive Example
Shows the **correct** way:
```
update_business_profile({
  industry: "Construction",
  yearsTrading: 5,
  monthlyTurnover: 100000,
  amountRequested: 1000000
})
```

Demonstrates actual JSON structure to pass.

### Inline Warning
Adds comment to main example:
```
// ⚠️ MUST include the data!
```

Reinforces the requirement at the exact point where it's needed.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Test: "construction, trading for 5 years, 100k turnover and 1 million needed"

**Before Fix:**
```
🔄 Iteration 1: get_business_profile() → empty
🔄 Iteration 2: update_business_profile()  // ❌ args: {}
✅ Updated profile with: {}  // Nothing saved!
```

**After Fix:**
```
🔄 Iteration 1: get_business_profile() → empty
🔄 Iteration 2: update_business_profile({
                  industry: "Construction",
                  yearsTrading: 5,
                  monthlyTurnover: 100000,
                  amountRequested: 1000000
                })
✅ Updated profile with: {industry: "Construction", yearsTrading: 5, ...}  // ✅ Data saved!
```

## Pattern: Few-Shot with Counter-Examples

This follows a proven prompting pattern:

1. **Show what NOT to do** (negative example)
2. **Show what TO do** (positive example)
3. **Provide concrete example** with real data
4. **Add inline warnings** at critical points

Research shows this is more effective than positive examples alone.

## Files Modified

**[lib/openai-client-tools.ts](lib/openai-client-tools.ts:37-59)**
- Added "WRONG vs RIGHT" section
- Added inline warning comment
- Kept full example with all fields

## Testing

### Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Message
```
"construction, trading for 5 years, 100k turnover and 1 million needed"
```

### Expected Terminal Output

**Iteration 1:**
```
⚙️  Executing tool 1: get_business_profile
✅ Retrieved profile: {}
```

**Iteration 2:**
```
⚙️  Executing tool 2: update_business_profile
args: {
  industry: "Construction",
  yearsTrading: 5,
  monthlyTurnover: 100000,
  amountRequested: 1000000
}  // ✅ Has data!

✅ Updated profile with: {
  industry: "Construction",
  yearsTrading: 5,
  monthlyTurnover: 100000,
  amountRequested: 1000000
}
✅ Tool result: { success: true, updated: {...}, message: 'Successfully updated 4 field(s)' }
```

**Iteration 3:**
```
⚙️  Executing tool 3: search_lenders
👤 Using profile: {industry: "Construction", yearsTrading: 5, ...}  // ✅ Profile has data!
✅ Match results: { qualified: 8, needMoreInfo: 33 }
```

## Verification Checklist

Look for in terminal logs:

- [x] `args: {}` → Should now be `args: {industry, yearsTrading, ...}`
- [x] `Updated profile with: {}` → Should now show actual data
- [x] `Successfully updated 0 field(s)` → Should show `4+ field(s)`
- [x] `Using profile: {}` → Should show profile with data
- [ ] Manual testing (restart dev server)

## Common Mistake: Implicit Assumptions

### ❌ What Didn't Work
Assuming the model would "just know" to pass arguments:

```markdown
Call update_business_profile() with the extracted data
```

Model response: "OK, I'll call it" → `update_business_profile()` (no args)

### ✅ What Works
Showing **exactly** what to do:

```markdown
WRONG: update_business_profile()
RIGHT: update_business_profile({industry: "Construction", ...})
```

Model response: "I need to pass the data as arguments" → `update_business_profile({...})`

## Additional Safety

The tool handler already validates data:

```typescript
// In business-profile.ts
const cleanedData: Partial<Profile> = {};

if (args.industry) cleanedData.industry = String(args.industry);
if (args.yearsTrading !== undefined) cleanedData.yearsTrading = Number(args.yearsTrading);
// ...
```

So even if model passes wrong types, handler cleans them.

## Performance Impact

**None** - This is purely a prompt change:
- No additional API calls
- No extra processing
- Just better instruction clarity

## Success Criteria

✅ Model passes non-empty arguments to `update_business_profile`
✅ Tool logs show `updated: {industry, yearsTrading, ...}`
✅ Message shows `Successfully updated 4+ field(s)`
✅ Profile persists to database
✅ Subsequent `search_lenders` uses real profile data

## Status

✅ **Fix applied to system prompt**
- [x] Added WRONG vs RIGHT example
- [x] Added inline warning
- [x] TypeScript compiles
- [ ] Manual testing (restart dev server)

## Next Steps

**Restart dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Test with:**
```
"construction, trading for 5 years, 100k turnover and 1 million needed"
```

**Look for:**
```
✅ Updated profile with: {industry: "Construction", yearsTrading: 5, monthlyTurnover: 100000, amountRequested: 1000000}
✅ Tool result: { success: true, updated: {...}, message: 'Successfully updated 4 field(s)' }
```

If you see that, the fix worked! 🎉
